## Setup

To install/manage the dependencies, we use uv, which can be installed using the instructions on [this](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) website.

After that, you can simply run `uv sync` to install all the current dependencies.

If you want to add dependencies, use `uv add <your python dependency>`.
